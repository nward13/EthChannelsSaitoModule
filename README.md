# EthChannels (UI only)

This branch negates all of the Ethereum contract calls to allow the module to be demoed without submitting Rinkeby transactions. The module does still require valid Ethereum addresses and payment signatures in the correct form, so here is a valid payment signature to copy and paste for testing purposes:

The Channels contract is currently deployed on the Rinkeby testnet at: 0x8994743c6631F2b4bfC9a97e17fb39A28b0502e1
